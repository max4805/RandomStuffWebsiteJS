# max480-random-stuff website, JS edition

This is the source code for max480-random-stuff.**herokuapp**.com... not to be confused with max480-random-stuff.**appspot**.com (that one is in [there](https://github.com/max4805/RandomStuffWebsite)).

This is a separate website just because I wanted to try new things. :sweat_smile: This one uses [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for the backend, [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for the frontend.

Two services are present there:
- [Banana Mirror Browser](https://max480-random-stuff.herokuapp.com/banana-mirror-browser), a website that can substitute to [the GameBanana Celeste section](https://gamebanana.com/games/6460) if it is down. Files and images are [hosted on 0x0ade's server](https://celestemodupdater.0x0a.de/). Mod info and files on this server are kept up-to-date by [the Everest update checker](https://github.com/max4805/EverestUpdateCheckerServer).
- [Wipe Converter](https://max480-random-stuff.herokuapp.com/wipe-converter), a service to turn custom Celeste screen wipes into a format the game can use (with the [max480's Helping Hand](https://github.com/max4805/MaxHelpingHand) mod).
